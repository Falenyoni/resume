# Getting Started with React 18 - Key Features and Migration Guide

React 18 introduces several game-changing features that improve performance and developer experience. In this post, I'll walk through the major updates and provide a step-by-step migration guide.

## Key Features in React 18

### 1. Automatic Batching

React 18 now automatically batches all state updates, regardless of where they originate from - events, promises, or timeouts. This reduces unnecessary re-renders and improves performance.

```jsx
// Before React 18: These state updates caused two separate renders
fetch('/api/data').then(() => {
  setLoading(false);
  setData(result);
});

// React 18: These are automatically batched into a single render
fetch('/api/data').then(() => {
  setLoading(false);
  setData(result);
});
```

### 2. Transitions

Transitions mark UI updates that don't require immediate user feedback, allowing React to prioritize more critical updates.

```jsx
import { startTransition } from 'react';

// Urgent update - happens immediately
setInputValue(input);

// Mark non-urgent updates as transitions
startTransition(() => {
  // This update can be interrupted if there's something more important
  setSearchResults(filterResults(input));
});
```

### 3. Suspense on the Server

React 18 extends Suspense to work on the server, enabling streaming server rendering and selective hydration.

## Migration Guide

### Step 1: Update Dependencies

```bash
npm install react@18 react-dom@18
```

### Step 2: Update Entry Point

```jsx
// Before React 18
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));

// React 18
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);
```

### Step 3: Review Breaking Changes

- `useEffect` now runs twice in development mode to help catch cleanup bugs
- Automatic batching might change the timing of updates in your application
- Strict Mode has additional checks that may catch issues

### Step 4: Adopt New Features Incrementally

Start with the createRoot API, then gradually incorporate other features like Suspense and transitions as you become familiar with them.

## Conclusion

React 18 brings substantial improvements to the framework's performance and developer experience. By migrating and adopting these new features, you'll be able to build more responsive and efficient React applications.
