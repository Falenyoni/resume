# Why Markdown Blog Posts Won't Work in an S3 Bucket

When building a blog system that uses markdown files as content sources (like this blog), deploying it to an Amazon S3 bucket isn't as straightforward as it may seem. There are several important limitations to understand.

## 1. Server-Side Processing Is Required

Markdown blogs typically rely on server-side processing to:
- Parse markdown files into HTML
- Generate dynamic content listings
- Handle URL routing for blog posts

S3 is purely a static file hosting service. It can serve files exactly as they are stored but cannot execute server-side code like Node.js/Express that powers many markdown blogs.

## 2. API Endpoint Limitations

Modern blog implementations often use API endpoints (like `/blog-posts/index.json`) to:
- Retrieve post metadata
- Dynamically load content
- Fetch post listings

S3 static hosting has no API capability - it can only serve pre-existing files at their exact paths without any server-side processing.

## 3. Client-Side Routing Issues

Single-page applications (SPAs) commonly use client-side routing with techniques like `history.pushState()` for clean URLs (e.g., `/blog/post-slug`). When a user directly visits such a URL or refreshes the page, S3 will look for an actual file at that exact path rather than letting your JavaScript router handle the request.

## Solutions to Make It Work

### 1. Pre-render to Static HTML

Convert your markdown files to static HTML during the build process:
```
Markdown Files → Build Process → Static HTML Files
```

This approach requires:
- A build script that processes all markdown into HTML pages
- Generation of a static `index.json` file for your client-side JavaScript
- Creating physical HTML files for each blog post

### 2. CloudFront with Lambda@Edge

Enhance S3 hosting with AWS CloudFront and Lambda@Edge:
- Store content in S3
- Set up CloudFront as your CDN
- Configure Lambda@Edge functions to handle dynamic processing

### 3. JAMstack Approach

Use a static site generator like Next.js, Gatsby, or 11ty:
- These tools pre-build pages at deploy time
- Convert markdown to HTML automatically
- Generate all necessary static files for S3 hosting

### 4. AWS Amplify

AWS Amplify provides a more integrated solution:
- Handles server-side rendering
- Manages deployment complexity
- Still uses S3 for storage underneath

### 5. API Gateway + Lambda Backend

Split your architecture:
- Host static frontend files on S3
- Create a separate backend using API Gateway and Lambda functions
- Use the backend to process markdown and serve blog data

## Conclusion

While S3 is excellent for hosting static websites, a markdown-based blog requires either:
1. Pre-rendering all content to static HTML
2. Adding additional AWS services to handle the dynamic aspects
3. Switching to a JAMstack approach designed for static hosting

The simplest solution is pre-rendering your blog to static HTML files during the build process, allowing S3 to serve them directly without needing any server-side processing.
